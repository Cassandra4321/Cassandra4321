Hello there! 👋😄

My name is Cassandra, and I'm a newly graduate .NET developer!  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a bookingsystem for a fictional gym/yoga studio [BookingSystemGit](https://github.com/Cassandra4321/BookingSystem). This is a continuation of my final exam project.
  
  💡 The project is built with a .NET C# backend that follows the principles of a REST API, so it uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow clients to create, retrieve, update, and delete data such as bookings, classes, and users.
  
  💻 On the frontend, I'm using React with TypeScript to build a responsive and interactive user interface, which communicates with the backend through the REST API.
  
  ⚙️ This setup makes the application modular, scalable, easy to maintain, and helps me practice fullstack development with modern technologies.


- 🧠 During my spare time when I'm not working on my previously mentioned project (or searching for my first junior position👀), I’m trying to learning Python and the fundamentals of machine learning, as I'm very interested in AI!
