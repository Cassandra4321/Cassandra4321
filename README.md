Hello! 👋

My name is Cassandra, and I'm a newly graduate .NET developer!
-  I'm currently creating a personal finance app, which will be using microservices architecture (something I'm new too and eager to learn!). 

-  I’ve also got a project for a horse/stable application, using .NET and Angular. [EquiLog](https://github.com/Cassandra4321/EquiLog) 🐴 
  
- My final exam project was a bookingsystem for a fictional gym/yoga studio [BookingSystemGit](https://github.com/Cassandra4321/BookingSystem).
  
  💡 This project is built with a .NET C# backend that follows the principles of a REST API, so it uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow clients to create, retrieve, update, and delete data such as bookings, classes, and users.
  
  💻 On the frontend, I'm using React with TypeScript to build a responsive and interactive user interface, which communicates with the backend through the REST API.
  
  ⚙️ This setup makes the application modular, scalable, easy to maintain, and helps me practice fullstack development with modern technologies.


- 🧠 During my spare time when I'm not working on my previously mentioned project (or searching for my first junior position👀), I’m learning Python and the fundamentals of machine learning, as I'm very interested in AI!
